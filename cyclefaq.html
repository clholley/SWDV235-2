                <div>
                    <p class="boldtext">What is cancer?</p>

                    <p>Cancer is a common name for diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells.</p>

                    <p class="boldtext">How does cancer start?</p>

                    <p>The specific reasons cancer starts vary greatly from individual to individual as well as between the different types of cancers.  However, scientific studies have proven that several factors are known to trigger or accelerate cancer such as extensive use of tobacco or alcohol, inappropriate exposure to radiation or to toxic substances such as asbestos, and even certain viruses. </p>

                    <p class="boldtext">Is cancer a contagious disease?</p>

                    <p>Studies have not shown cancer to be contagious although certain cancers do seem to run in families such as breast cancer.</p>

                    <p class="boldtext">Is it possible to prevent cancer?</p>

                    <p>While there are no certain ways to prevent cancer, studies have proven that people with healthy diets and lifestyles are less likely to get cancer than those do not.</p>

                    <p class="boldtext">What are the early warning signs of cancer?</p>

                    <p>Cancer often masks itself with many different symptoms which are common of much lesser ailments. Unfortunately sometimes cancer shows no obvious symptoms at all.  These warning signs should be checked out by a doctor:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>a sore or ulcer that doesn't heal</li>
                        <li>unusual bleeding</li>
                        <li>an unusual thickening or lump</li>
                        <li>change in a wart or mole</li>
                        <li>any persistent pain, fever, or physical limitation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <p>Seeing the parade of motorcycles from all over the United States was super exciting.</p>
                    <p>They brought pins and patches from all over the United States and put them on a sash to decorate my wheelchair.</p>
                    <p>After so many days of pain and boredom, seeing the Cycle Out Cancer riders was a real thrill!  ~ Jennifer</p>

                    <p>
                        I spent 10 days in the hospital just crying. The Cycle Out Cancer guys were so colorful and generous. They gave the hospital a very generous donation in my name and showed me
                        that even strangers care about me. ~ Kristen
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I had the good fortune to meet several Cycle Out Cancer guys. Everyone has been touched
                        by cancer.  They are out there doing something about it. ~ Fritz

                        As soon as my treatments are over, I'm getting a Spyder motorcycle to ride with Cycle Out Cancer.
